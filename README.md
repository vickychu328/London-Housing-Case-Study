## Introduction

This project explores housing price trends across London boroughs, focusing on identifying areas that have seen the most significant increases in house prices over a 20-year period. The analysis uses historical data on average house prices in each borough from 1995 to 2018.

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `London_Borough`: The name of the London borough.
- `ID`: A unique identifier for each borough.
- `Month`: The date of the recorded price.
- `Average_price`: The average house price for that month.
- `Year`: The extracted year from the `Month` column for easier analysis.

### Example of data:

| London_Borough     | Year | Average_price |
|--------------------|------|---------------|
| Barking & Dagenham | 1995 | 51817.97      |
| Barking & Dagenham | 1996 | 51718.19      |
| Barking & Dagenham | 1997 | 55974.26      |
| Barking & Dagenham | 1998 | 60285.82      |
| Barking & Dagenham | 1999 | 65320.93      |

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The data was loaded, and any missing values were removed to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
2. **Data Transformation**: The `Month` column was used to extract the year, which was added as a new column (`Year`).
3. **Price Growth Calculation**: The ratio of house prices in 2018 compared to 1995 was calculated to determine the growth rate for each borough.
4. **Data Visualization**: Bar plots were generated to visualize the top 15 boroughs with the highest house price increase ratios.

## Key Findings

- **Hackney** has the highest house price increase ratio, with a value of 6.32 in 2018.
- Other notable boroughs with significant growth include **Waltham Forest**, **Southwark**, **Lewisham**, and **City of London**.
- **Barking & Dagenham** saw an increase ratio of 4.95, while **Brent** had a ratio of 4.71.

## Visualizations

- A bar chart was created to visualize the top 15 London boroughs with the highest house price growth in 2018
